# Canvas Course Checklist

This is a customized *Setup Checklist* for the **Harvard College/GSAS** account in Canvas. 

When instructors view their unpublished course home page, a button to access the checklist is prominently displayed:

Clicking on the button opens the checklist (original, unmodified checklist):

## Installation

Use the *Global Javascript URL* feature available on the canvas account settings page to point to [js/checklist.js](http://harvard-atg.github.io/canvas-course-checklist/js/checklist.js).

## Caveats

1. The external tool links are hard-coded and will only work for courses under the **Harvard College/GSAS** account.
2. This script uses undocumented features of Canvas to customize the the setup checklist, and could therefore break at any time if Canvas makes a change to their "course wizard" code.
