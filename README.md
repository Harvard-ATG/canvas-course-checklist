# Canvas Course Checklist

This is a customized *Setup Checklist* for canvas. It is only intended to be used on the **Harvard College/GSAS** account, as there are some hard-coded external tool links that will only work for courses under that account.

## Installation

Use the *Global Javascript URL* feature available on the canvas account settings page to point to [js/checklist.js](http://harvard-atg.github.io/canvas-course-checklist/js/checklist.js).

## Caveats

This script uses undocumented features of Canvas to customize the the setup checklist, and could therefore break at any time if Canvas makes a change to their "course wizard" code.
